## Problem statement

This project focuses on predicting the quality of red wine using a regression model based on various chemical properties. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains multiple features that describe the characteristics of red wine samples. The primary objective is to build a model that can accurately predict the quality of wine, which is rated on a scale from 0 to 10, using these features.

## Dataset Used
Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 12 columns, each representing a distinct attribute of the red wine samples:

**The dataset** The goal is to predict `quality` of given wine (Regression Analysis).

There are 11 independent variables:
1.  `Fixed Acidity`: The amount of non-volatile acids in the wine, mainly tartaric acid.
2. `Volatile Acidity`: The amount of acetic acid in the wine, which at high levels can lead to an unpleasant vinegar taste.
3. `Citric Acid`: A small amount of citric acid can add freshness and flavor to the wine.
4. `Residual Sugar`: The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, influencing the sweetness of the wine.
5. `Chlorides`: The amount of salt in the wine.
6. `Free Sulfur Dioxide`: The free form of SO2, which acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.
7. `Total Sulfur Dioxide`: The total amount of SO2, which includes both free and bound forms.
8. `Density`: The density of the wine, which is closely related to the alcohol content and sugar level.
9. `pH`: Describes the acidity or alkalinity of the wine.
10. `Sulphates`: A wine additive that can contribute to the wine's sulfur dioxide levels, affecting its freshness and stability.
11. `Alcohol`: The alcohol content of the wine, contributing to its body and taste.

Target variable:

12. `Quality`: The target variable, which is the quality score assigned to the wine, ranging from 0 (very poor) to 10 (excellent).

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values, if any.
- Scaling features to ensure uniformity and improve model performance.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Analyzing the distribution of each feature.
- Investigating correlations between features and the target variable.
- Visualizing relationships through scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps.
### Model Selection:

- Experimenting with various regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression.
- Using cross-validation techniques to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
### Model Evaluation:

- Assessing model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score.
- Comparing the performance of different models to select the best one for predicting wine quality.
### Model Deployment:

- Finalizing the best model.
- Implementing the model in a production environment where it can be used to predict the quality of new wine samples based on their chemical properties.



## After finalizing the model, Industry standard object oriented programming approach for the project 

1. Data Ingestion : 
    * In Data Ingestion phase the data is first read as csv. 
    * Then the data is split into training and testing and saved as csv file.

2. Data Transformation : 
    * In this phase a ColumnTransformer Pipeline is created.
    * for Numerical Variables first SimpleImputer is applied with strategy median , then Standard Scaling is performed on numeric data.
    * for Categorical Variables: There were no categorical variables.
    * This preprocessor is saved as pickle file.

3. Model Training : 
    * In this phase base model is tested. The best model found was DecisionTreeRegressor.
    * After this hyperparameter tuning is performed on DecisionTreeRegressor and multiple model to get the best training r2 score.
    * A final DecisionTreeRegressor is selected.
    * This model is saved as pickle file.

4. Prediction Pipeline : 
    * This pipeline converts given data into dataframe and has various functions to load pickle files and predict the final results in python.

5. Flask App creation : 
    * Flask app is created with User Interface to predict the gemstone prices inside a Web Application.
6. Dockerization of the app :   
    * Dockerized the entire application using Docker tool and uploaded the docker image on Docker hub repository.
7. Deployment of the app :  
    * A Web Application is delpoyed on the AWS EC2 Instance.
8. CI/CD using GitHub Action:  
    * CI/CD pipeline is deployed using GitHub Action on the AWS EC2 Instance.
